# Qdrant Vector Database on Azure Cloud

<img src="./img/qdrant-plus-azure.png" width="480" height="300" />

This project combines the power of the Qdrant Vector Database with the Microsoft Azure Cloud
allowing you to bring Vector Search and Embeddings storage to your AI products.

## Getting started

You have several options for how to get Qdrant running on Azure:

- [Azure Kubernetes Service](Azure-Kubernetes-Svc/README.md)
- [Qdrant Container in Docker](Local-Docker-Deployment/README.md)

## Prerequisites

To get started, users will need access to an Azure subscription.

To deploy using the Deploy to Azure button which leverages an ARM template, you need write access on the resources you're deploying and access to all operations on the Microsoft.Resources/deployments resource type.

## Installation

### Azure Kubernetes Service

To deploy Qdrant to a cluster running in Azure Kubernetes Services, go to the `Azure-Kubernetes-Svc` folder and follow instructions in the `README.md` to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster with Load Balancer on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS).

You can quickly create an **Azure Kubernetes Service** cluster by clicking the Deploy to Azure button below. After creating your AKS cluster, go to the `Azure-Kubernetes-Svc` folder to deploy **Qdrant** into the AKS cluster using **Helm**.

#### AKS Prerequisites 
**PLEASE NOTE! ensure that you have a resource group and ssh key in that resource created before selecting the Deploy to Azure Button below. More details can be found in README.md in [Azure Kubernetes Service README.md](Azure-Kubernetes-Svc/README.md)**

### Docker (Local)

To develop against and run Qdrant locally. 

**VS Code Dev Container**
This project contains a dev container configuration which can be used for local development. To learn more about using a dev container, please review [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

**Docker Locally**
To run the **Qdrant** vector database running in **Docker** locally, please follow the instructions from Qdrant's website:
[Install Qdrant with Docker](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/install/#with-docker)

To run Qdrant with Docker locally, you can use the following command using  default values stored in the file `.config/config.yaml` located in the `Local-Docker-Deployment` folder.

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 \
    -v $(pwd)/path/to/data:/qdrant/storage \
    -v $(pwd)/path/to/custom_config.yaml:/qdrant/config/production.yaml \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

You can overwrite values by creating and adding new records to a file `./config/production.yaml`. An example of the production.yaml file located in the `Local-Docker-Deployment` directory. Please review the [Qdrant documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/install/#configuration) to learn more information on configuration options for **Qdrant**.
