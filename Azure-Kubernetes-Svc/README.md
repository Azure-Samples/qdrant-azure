# Qdrant Vector Database on Azure Cloud
Create a Qdrant vector database on Azure using:

- **Azure Kubernetes Service**
- **Helm (custom chart w/qdrant helm dependency)** 

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
To get started, users will need access to an Azure subscription.
Users will also need to have the following installed on their local machine:

  - **Helm:** 
  Helm can be installed via package manager or with the Helm script provided in folder `scripts` in this directory. 

  - **Kubectl:** 
  Tools for Kubernetes will need to installed. You install kubectl using the Azure CLI by executing the command. 

```bash
az aks install-cli
```
Alternative kubectl installation: Following the instructions in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

As a convenience, a kubectl install script is provided in the `scripts` folder in this directory.

## Installation

**Azure Kubernetes Service**

To deploy the **Qdrant** service on **Azure Kubernetes Service** with Azure Volume, you must first ensure that a AKS cluster is running. You can create a cluster using the Deploy to Azure button below, or manually using the Azure Portal or Azure CLI.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure-Samples%2Fqdrant-azure%2Fmain%2FAzure-Kubernetes-Svc%2Faks-arm-deploy.json)

After the AKS cluster has been created, you can deploy Qdrant on Azure Kubernetes Service with Helm. Go to the `qdrant-on-azure` folder which contains the Helm chart for Qdrant and run the following commands:

**Step 1:** Configure kubectl to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the `az aks get-credentials` command:

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <your-resource-group-name> --name <your-aks-cluster-name>
kubectl get nodes
```
**Step 2:** Install Qdrant on Azure Kubernetes Service with Helm by running the following command in the `qdrant-on-azure` folder:

```bash
 helm install <your-release-name> qdrant-on-azure --namespace azqrant --create-namespace
```
